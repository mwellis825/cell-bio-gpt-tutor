# app.py
# Prompt + Slides â†’ (1) 4Ã— Fill-in-the-Blank (prediction) + (2) Drag into Topic-Specific Bins
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# How it works
# - User types a topic prompt (no defaults).
# - App searches ./slides (PDF / txt / md / html).
# - It detects the topic from the prompt, then generates:
#   (1) FOUR warm, prediction-style fill-in-the-blank items (lenient grading).
#   (2) TRUE drag-and-drop (if streamlit-sortables is installed): draggable bank â†’ titled bins
#
# Environment
#   pip install streamlit
#   # PDFs:
#   pip install PyPDF2    # or: pip install pypdf
#   # Drag & drop (recommended):
#   pip install streamlit-sortables
#
# Run:
#   streamlit run app.py
